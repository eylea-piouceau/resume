\begin{rSection}{Professional Experience}

	\begin{rSubsection}{Research intern at IBPC (Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique)}{June 2023 - July 2023}{2-month internship within the "Microbial Genetic Expression" Unit (UMR8261 CNRS)}{Paris, France}
		\item As a Research Intern within the RNA control of gene expression team, I studied the regulation of gene expression in \textit{Escherichia coli.}
		\item For the project, I needed to carry out several laboratory techniques such as northern blot, bacterial transformation, site-directed mutagenesis, and $\beta$-galactosidase activity assays.
		\item I had the opportunity to develop my analytical thinking skills and gain a deeper understanding of the scientific approach.
	\end{rSubsection}

	\begin{rSubsection}{Part-time student worker - Courses review, Université de Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines}{May 2023 - June 2023}{Courses review for the HILISIT project (Hybridation LIcence ScIenTifique)}{Versailles, France}
		\item I was selected to participate in a project where I reviewed and corrected course materials written by university lecturers and researchers. The courses were centered on the core topics of molecular biology and were designed to serve as online educational resources for undergraduate students.
		\item This project allowed me to reflect on course structure and adapt concepts according to the students' proficiency levels.

\begin{rSection}{Personal Interests}
	\begin{rSubsection}{}{}{}{}
		\item I have been engaged in sports since childhood, initially with classical ballet for 10 years, followed by club volleyball for the past 5 years, along with Pilates and Yoga. Team sports have helped me develop team-working and communication skills, while sports in general have taught me perseverance and discipline.
		\item I am a volunteer at a neighborhood council, where during the summer of 2024, I assisted primary school students with their homework twice a week for two months. This experience taught me how to adapt to different profiles and develop a pedagogical approach to support the students.
